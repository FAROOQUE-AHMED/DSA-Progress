# DSA-Progress 🚀

This repository tracks my daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problem-solving journey.

## 📚 Platforms Covered:
- ✅ LeetCode (currently active)
- 🟨 Other platforms (to be added: GFG, Codeforces, etc.)

## 📁 Folder Structure:
```
DSA-Progress/
└── On-leetcode/
    ├── Easy/
    ├── Medium/
    └── Hard/
```
Each folder contains C++ solutions to problems categorized by difficulty.

## 🎯 Goals:
- Solve 1–3 DSA problems daily
- Focus on common patterns: sliding window, two pointers, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
- Build strong problem-solving speed and accuracy

## 📌 Progress Tracker (to be updated weekly)
- [ ] Week 1: ✅ Easy problems ✔️
- [ ] Week 2: ⏳ Medium + Easy mix
- [ ] Week 3: 🚧 Start with Hard
